# Privacy Policy for Synaptimo Focus

**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025

Synaptimo ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Synaptimo Focus browser extension (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data.

**Our guiding principle is to collect the minimum data necessary to provide and improve the Service. Your privacy and trust are of the utmost importance to us.**

---

## 1. Data We DO NOT Collect

We want to be crystal clear about what we **never** collect:

- ❌ We **DO NOT** collect your browsing history
- ❌ We **DO NOT** track what videos you watch
- ❌ We **DO NOT** monitor your YouTube activity
- ❌ We **DO NOT** collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or user accounts
- ❌ We **DO NOT** use cookies or tracking pixels
- ❌ We **DO NOT** share any data with third parties

---

## 2. How Synaptimo Focus Works

The extension operates entirely locally on your device:

1. **URL Detection** - The extension monitors the current page URL to detect YouTube Shorts
2. **Local Blocking** - When a Shorts URL is detected, CSS is injected locally to hide content
3. **Local Redirect** - After a countdown, the browser redirects to YouTube's homepage
4. **No Network Requests** - The extension makes no external network requests or API calls

**All processing happens on your device. Nothing leaves your browser.**

---

## 3. Permissions Explained

Synaptimo Focus requests minimal permissions:

### `host_permissions: ["https://www.youtube.com/*"]`
**Why we need it:** To detect and block YouTube Shorts URLs on YouTube's website.

**What we don't do with it:** We do not read, collect, or transmit any data from YouTube or any other website.

## 4. Future Features (Planned)

We are planning a "Pro" version with additional features. Here's how we'll handle data:

### Personal Analytics Dashboard (Pro)
- **Data collected:** Number of Shorts blocked, time saved estimates
- **Storage:** All data stored **exclusively on your local device** using Chrome's local storage API
- **Transmission:** This data is **never transmitted to our servers** or any third party
- **Access:** Only you can see this data. It's for your eyes only.

### Anonymous Usage Analytics (Future)
If we implement analytics in the future:
- We will update this policy first
- Analytics will be completely anonymous and aggregated
- We will use a privacy-focused service (e.g., anonymous events only)
- You will have the option to opt-out

**We will notify all users before implementing any analytics.**
