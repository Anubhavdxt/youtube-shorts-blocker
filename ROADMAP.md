## Technical Architecture for Pro Features

### Storage Strategy
```javascript
// Free tier
chrome.storage.local:
- shorts_blocked_today: number
- last_reset_date: timestamp
- extension_enabled: boolean

// Pro tier (all local)
chrome.storage.local:
- shorts_blocked_total: number
- shorts_blocked_by_date: { [date]: count }
- time_saved_minutes: number
- longest_streak: number
- pro_license_key: string
- pro_expiry_date: timestamp
- advanced_blocking_settings: object
- custom_redirect_url: string
- whitelist: string[]
```

### Payment Verification
```javascript
// Lemon Squeezy Integration
1. User purchases on Lemon Squeezy checkout
2. Webhook sends license key to extension
3. Extension validates license key with Lemon Squeezy API
4. Store encrypted license in chrome.storage.local
5. Periodic validation (daily) to prevent abuse
```

### Feature Gates
```javascript
// src/shared/pro.js
export class ProManager {
  static async isPro() {
    // Check license validity
  }

  static async showUpgradePrompt() {
    // Beautiful modal encouraging upgrade
  }

  static lockFeature(featureName) {
    // Blur + upgrade overlay
  }
}
```
